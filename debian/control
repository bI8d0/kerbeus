Description: Kerberos AS-REQ & AS-REP Sniffer for security analysis
 Kerbeus is a specialized packet sniffer for capturing and analyzing Kerberos
 authentication traffic. It correlates AS-REQ and AS-REP messages to extract
 Pre-Authentication hashes that can be used for offline password cracking.
 .
 Features:
  * Capture Kerberos AS-REQ and AS-REP packets on port 88/TCP and 88/UDP
  * Extract Pre-Authentication hashes (PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP)
  * Support for AES128, AES256, and RC4-HMAC encryption types (etype 17, 18, 23)
  * Automatic salt extraction from PA-ETYPE-INFO and PA-ETYPE-INFO2
  * Automatic deduplication to avoid duplicate hashes
  * John the Ripper compatible hash format ($krb5pa$)
  * Optional MITM ARP spoofing with ettercap integration
  * Interactive capture with real-time color-coded output
  * Automatic correlation of AS-REQ and AS-REP packets by user
 .
 Usage:
  sudo ./kerbeus
  sudo ./kerbeus -i eth0
 .
 Requirements:
  * Root/sudo permissions (for packet capture)
  * Linux with AF_PACKET support (Kali Linux recommended)
  * Ettercap (optional, for MITM ARP spoofing)
  * Access to Kerberos traffic (usually on port 88)
